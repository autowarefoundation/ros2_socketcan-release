ros-humble-ros2-socketcan (1.2.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Add CAN FD Support (#28 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/ros2_socketcan/issues/28>)
    * Add FD support to ROS2 interface.
    * Add FD send/receive.
    * Missed some fields in Frame msg.
    * Make standard and FD mutually exclusive.
    * Enable runtime checks for standard vs FD.
    * Try to minimize API changes.
    * Fix receive_id/fd_receive_id mix-up.
    * Make new message FD-specific.
    * Use FdFrame message.
    * Remove unused functions.
    * Always resize fd frame buffer to 64 before receive.
    * Add enable_can_fd to socket_can_bridge.launch.xml.
    ---------
  * SocketCAN filters (#25 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/ros2_socketcan/issues/25>)
    * SocketCAN filters
    Filters can be set using launch parameter.
    A list of pairs (can id and mask) are fetched and applied to
    socket filter.
    Added unit test for filters application and fuctionality.
    * Full support of SocketCAN filters
    SocketCAN filters can be now
    with string description used
    by candump utility.
    Added support for error masks
    and joined CAN filters.
    Instead of list of integers, receiver
    node now uses string parameter
    in order to receive filters. Filters will
    now be parsed and setup during
    configuration.
    Added unit test for parsing and
    updated filters unit test.
    * Reference to man-pages docs of filters syntax
    Added links referencing man-pages docs for candump,
    containing more information about socketcan filters
    syntax used. Links were added to doxygen documentation
    of filters parsing method and to launch argument
    description.
  * Fix unit conversion bug in to_timeval() (#24 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/ros2_socketcan/issues/24>)
  * Reorganize folders for adding ros2_socketcan_msgs (#23 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/ros2_socketcan/issues/23>)
    Reorganize folders to permit adding a msgs package.
